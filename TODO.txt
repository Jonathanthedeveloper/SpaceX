render the admin kyc ; check kyc controller for kyc data

Some errors I have uncovered

1. Welcome back notification, I mean the flash, the positioning and all, and it doesn't go away.
2. Wallet all round, are empty
3. When a user invests $2 is removed and the rest is accounted for. Eg a user wants to invest 500, the website takes $2 away, and the user ends up investing 498
4. Delete and Verify buttons in the users page not working
5. KYC Time and stuff

Questions 
2. Wallet all round, are empty ; please explain 
3. Please make sure to test this well or send me a video that shows this. I have tested this and it works fine.
